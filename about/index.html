	<h1>About</h1>
	<p>
  A software engineer with background in embedded software in the aerospace industry.
  I have worked on control and health monitoring systems for many gas turbine engines.
  My experience spans from application software down to operating system internals
  and device drivers.
	</p>

	<p>
	I currently work at Rolls-Royce building the next-generation power systems for the aviation
	industry, and also a computer science graduate student at
	<a href=https://www.iupui.edu/>Indiana University - Purdue University</a>, Indianapolis.
  </p>

	<p>
	My favorite dialect is C, I do C++ here and there, mostly for tooling. I default to
	Java and Matlab for school projects and Python for hardware-in-the-loop testing at work.
	I played with MPI and CUDA during an awesome High Performance Computing class at IUPUI.
