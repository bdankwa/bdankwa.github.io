I am a software engineer with background in embedded software in the aerospace industry.
I have worked on control and health monitoring systems for many gas turbine engines.
My experience spans from application software down to operating system internals
and device drivers.

I currently work at Rolls-Royce building the next-generation power systems for the aviation
industry, and also a computer science graduate student at [IUPUI](https://www.iupui.edu/).

My favorite dialect is C, I do C++ here and there, mostly for tooling. I default to
Java and Matlab for school projects and Python for hardware-in-the-loop testing at work.
I played with MPI and CUDA during an awesome High Performance Computing class at IUPUI.
